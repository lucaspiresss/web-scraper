One of my key objectives this year was to lead and scale the production releases preparation and coordination process. I successfully supported approximately 25 production releases, including numerical and off-cycle releases. Achieving this required close collaboration with teams like SWAT, Release Management, EP, and ASR. To enhance scalability, I trained team members during the release process, reducing dependency on a single individual and increasing the team’s operational resilience.

As part of the “Faster and Safer Releases” platform OKR, I developed scripts to automate several manual steps in production releases, including web server verification, RAConfig folder backups, and Autosys job status updates. These automations streamlined the process, reduced potential for errors, reduced human effort for ASR team, and reduced overall release duration up to three hours . Additionally, I created a script to analyze late merge requests, enabling better tracking and decision-making regarding late-scope additions.

I also led the merge request review process, ensuring code quality and readiness for deployment. This included guiding developers, especially new joiners after the CS merging, by answering questions and sharing knowledge about the process. This effort maintained repository quality while fostering a supportive learning environment.

On the technical side, still aligned with my objectives, I developed scriptsthat improved deployment stability and efficiency, addressing bugs that used to happen during the deployment of critical components like RAConfig, Autosys and ADT App. A notable achievement was refactoring Autosys jil definition files, reducing deployment time by approximately 90%, a significant efficiency gain.

Beyond these contributions, I supported the onboarding and migration of components to our automation tools on GitLab. These components were either new or moved on UBS Deploy from organizations RAIT to RiskAnalyticsIT. As examples, I can list PokerDataService, CommMarketData, KryptonService, and KubernetesJobService.

Another key objective was enhancing code quality tooling. I implemented code coverage reports across repositories, improving test coverage and overall code reliability. I shared this work during a live demonstration at the bRAin Exchange Forum, presenting to an audience of around 60 people. The session highlighted the implementation process and the importance of integrating code coverage metrics into merge requests.

To support continuous learning, I strengthened my technical knowledge through courses, seminars, and conferences. A notable milestone was earning the Certified Engineer Silver title from UBS.

Finally, I contributed to UBS’s community initiatives as a volunteer, participating in the “Beyond Labels” inclusive job fair and the “Spread Your Wings” mentorship program supporting individuals displaced by the war in Ukraine. These initiatives provided opportunities to network and make a positive difference in people’s lives.
