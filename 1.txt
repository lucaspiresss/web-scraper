Your structure looks really solid already — it’s clear, organized, and touches all the key points that matter for a dashboard presentation. That said, I have a few suggestions to improve the flow, polish the language, and possibly enhance clarity and impact:

⸻

Refined Version of Your Presentation Plan

⸻

1. Introduction
	•	Purpose: Explain the motivation behind creating the dashboard (e.g., improving visibility on MR activity, helping teams track productivity, etc.)
	•	Why Power BI: Highlight ease of use, powerful data modeling, corporate adoption, or any relevant factors.

⸻

2. Dashboard Overview
	•	Interface Walkthrough: Briefly present the layout and structure.
	•	Key Sections: Highlight the main components (e.g., KPIs, charts, filters, etc.)

⸻

3. How to Use the Dashboard
	•	Interactive Elements:
	•	Available slicers and filters
	•	Ability to sort data in visualizations
	•	Drill-through capabilities or focus mode (if applicable)
	•	Classification Logic:
	•	Explain how Merge Requests are flagged as “late”

⸻

4. Data Pipeline Overview
	•	Data Sources:
	•	GitLab for MRs (via GraphQL)
	•	RM Excel file for release information
	•	Data Flow:
	•	Diagram/image showing table relationships
	•	Python script triggered by a GitLab scheduled job
	•	Data storage in Cosmos DB
	•	Power BI data refresh via Data Gateway and scheduled syncs

⸻

5. Dashboard Publishing & CI/CD
	•	Deployment Process:
	•	Shared Power BI workspace
	•	Dashboard file stored in a dedicated repository
	•	Automated pipeline to deploy the dashboard (hands-free publishing)

⸻

6. Future Enhancements
	•	Expand repository coverage
	•	Automate the release table update process
	•	Add new visuals/screens based on feedback

⸻

7. Acknowledgements
	•	Emphasis on user-centric design
	•	Alignment with UBS UI/UX guidelines
	•	Shout-out to Amir for backend and deployment support

⸻

8. Q&A

⸻

9. (Optional) Live Demo
	•	Offer to open Power BI Desktop for a deeper dive (only if there’s interest)

⸻

Optional Tweaks:
	•	Consider having a 1-slide executive summary before jumping into the interface, summarizing key insights the dashboard provides (this gives context to managers before the technical details).
	•	If time allows, it might be useful to briefly show a before/after comparison (how things were tracked before vs. now with the dashboard).

Would you like me to help you turn this into a polished presentation script or slides?









Presentation of Dashboard

# Introduction
Why it was created
Why used Power BI

# Presentation of the interface
Show sections present in the dashboard

# How to use the dashboard
Possible slicers and filters
How the MR is classified as late
Possibility to sort data on views
Possibility on focus one view

# How we populate the data
MRs from GitLab
Releases from RM excel file
Show image with relation between tables
Queries from GraphQL accessing GitLab API
Store the data on Cosmos DB
Scheduled job on GitLab that runs a python script send data to Cosmos DB
Use Datasource Gateways to sync data between Cosmos DB and Power BI
Use scheduled syncs

# How we publish it
Published in a shared workspace
We created a repository where we can upload the dashboard file and from this repository we have an automatic pipeline that will publish the dashboard directly on this shared workspace (hands free)

# Next improvements
Expand the list of repositories tracked on the dashboard
Automate update of release table
Prepare new screens and visuals according to user needs

# Honorable mentions
Focus on user experience
Follow UBS guidelines for creation of interfaces
Mention great support from Amir on preparing backend for data population and dashboard publish

# Questions?

# If there’s interest, I can show power bi desktop
